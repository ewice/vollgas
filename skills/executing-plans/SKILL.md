# Executing Plans

## Overview

**Fallback execution method** for environments without subagent support. If subagents are
available, use vollgas:subagent-driven-development instead — it provides fresh context
per task and two-stage review, which produces significantly higher quality results.

Load plan, review critically, execute all tasks, report when complete.

**Announce at start:** "I'm using the executing-plans skill to implement this plan."

## The Process

### Step 1: Load and Review Plan
1. Read plan file
2. Review critically - identify any questions or concerns about the plan
3. If concerns: Raise them with your human partner before starting
4. If no concerns: Create TodoWrite and proceed

### Step 2: Execute Tasks

For each task:
1. Mark as in_progress
2. Follow each step exactly (plan has bite-sized steps)
3. Run verifications as specified
4. Mark as completed

### Step 3: Review Gate

After all tasks complete and verified:
- Announce: "I'm using the review-gate skill to run the post-implementation review."
- **REQUIRED SUB-SKILL:** Use vollgas:review-gate
- Follow that skill to run reviewers, validate findings, and hand off to finishing

## When to Stop and Ask for Help

**STOP executing immediately when:**
- Hit a blocker (missing dependency, test fails, instruction unclear)
- Plan has critical gaps preventing starting
- You don't understand an instruction
- Verification fails repeatedly

**Ask for clarification rather than guessing.**

## When to Revisit Earlier Steps

**Return to Review (Step 1) when:**
- Partner updates the plan based on your feedback
- Fundamental approach needs rethinking

**Don't force through blockers** - stop and ask.

## Remember
- Review plan critically first
- Follow plan steps exactly
- Don't skip verifications
- Reference skills when plan says to
- Stop when blocked, don't guess
- Never start implementation on main/master branch without explicit user consent

## Integration

**Required workflow skills:**
- **vollgas:using-git-worktrees** - REQUIRED: Set up isolated workspace before starting
- **vollgas:writing-plans** - Creates the plan this skill executes
- **vollgas:review-gate** - Post-implementation review before finishing
